            Switzerland has low unemployment, a skilled labor force and one of the highest gross domestic products per capita in the world, according to the CIA World Factbook. The country’s strong economy is powered by low corporate tax rates, a highly-developed service sector led by financial services and a high-tech manufacturing industry.

            The country’s cultural contributions are disproportionate to its small size. Swiss citizens have won more Nobel Prizes and registered more patents per capita than most other nations. And its neutrality during periods of conflict attracted some of the world’s greatest minds to immigrate, including James Joyce, George Byron and Voltaire.

            The country prides itself on its diversity, and is home to regions with distinct cultural identities. German, French, Italian and Romansh language all enjoy national status.
